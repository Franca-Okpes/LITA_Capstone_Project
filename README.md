 ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps uncover insights by addressing key questions such as:

 -   How does performance vary across regions?
 -   What are the monthly sales trends?
 -   What is the total revenue?
 -   How much revenue does each product generate annually?
